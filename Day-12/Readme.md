## Overview

This is a challenge of the #100daysofUI and the prompt was as follows:

Prompt: On/Off Switch

Consider what's being turned on/off and how it should be done. Is it a push-to-start electric vehicle? A control panel for a smart refrigerator or some other touch-panel display?

## My process

- First I did research on the different types of Switches UI from Dribbble and Behance websites.
- After that, I created a simple mockup using Figma.
- Then I built a shell using React and Tailwind.
- Functionality will be added later on.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS
- React

### Continued development

- Create more projects to polish up tailwind, React and design principles using Figma.
