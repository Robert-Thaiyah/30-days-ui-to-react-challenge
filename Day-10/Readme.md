## Overview

This is a challenge of the #100daysofUI and the prompt was as follows:

Prompt: Social Share

Design a social share button/icon and be mindful of the size, imagery, placement, and purpose for sharing. It could be to share an article snippet, or a simple link with a photo.

## My process

- First I did research on the different trypes of Social Share pages from Dribbble and Behance websites.
- After that, I created a simple mockup using Figma and Adobe XD.
- Then I built a shell using Reactand Material Tailwind.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS
- React

### Continued development

- Create more projects to polish up tailwind, React and design principles using Figma.
