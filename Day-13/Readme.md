## Overview

This is a challenge of the #100daysofUI and the prompt was as follows:

Prompt: Direct Message

Design a Direct Messaging app, profile, or chat box. Consider the parties involved in the messages, images, placement, and context of the messages. Are the messages for social purposes? Customer support?

## My process

- First I did research on the different types of messaging UI from Dribbble and Behance websites.
- After that, I created a simple mockup using Figma.
- Then I built a shell using React and Tailwind.
- Functionality will be added later on.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS

### Continued development

- Create more projects to polish up tailwind, React and design principles using Figma.
