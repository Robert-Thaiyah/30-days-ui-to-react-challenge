## Overview

This is a challenge of the #100daysofUI and the prompt was as follows:

Prompt:  404 Page Design

Design a 404 page - that's not boring! 
 
Does it suit the brand's style? Is it user-friendly? It might sound mundane, but not everything can be flashy or glamorous. Every day millions of people will be landing on 404 pages. You have an opportunity to help them in a way that's useful and aesthetically pleasing. (It's up to you!)

## My process

- First I did research on the different trypes of UI 404 pages from Dribbble and Behance websites.
- After that, I created a simple mockup using Figma and Adobe XD.
- Then I built a shell using React and Tailwind.
- Added some small functionality using Javascript (later).
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS

### Continued development

- Create more projects to polish up tailwind, React and design principles using Figma.
