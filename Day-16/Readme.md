## Overview

This is a challenge of the #100daysofUI and the prompt was as follows:

Prompt: Pop-up Overlay

Is it for a newsletter sign-up form ? Is it an ad overlay? A gated subscription page such as for premium news or member-only access?

## My process

- First I did research on the different types of modals from Dribbble and Behance websites.
- After that, I created a simple mockup using Figma.
- Then I built a shell using React and Tailwind.
- Functionality added using React States.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS
- React

### Continued development

- Create more projects to polish up tailwind, React and design principles using Figma.
