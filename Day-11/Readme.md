## Overview

This is a challenge of the #100daysofUI and the prompt was as follows:

Prompt: Flash Message

Design a Flash Message with both the error message and success message. Is it for a sign up form? A download/upload message? Is it to promote a membership plan?

## My process

- First I did research on the different types of Flash Messages UI from Dribbble and Behance websites.
- After that, I created a simple mockup using Figma.
- Then I built a shell using React and Tailwind.
- Animations will be added later.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS
- React

### Continued development

- Create more projects to polish up tailwind, React and design principles using Figma.
