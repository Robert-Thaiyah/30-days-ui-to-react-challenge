## Overview

This is a challenge of the #100daysofUI and the prompt was as follows:

Prompt: User Profile

Design a user profile and be mindful of the most important data, names, imagery, placement, etc. Is it for a serious profile? A social profile? (It's up to you!)

## My process

- First I did research on the different trypes of user profiles pages from Dribbble and Behance websites.
- After that, I created a simple mockup using Adobe XD.
- Then I built a shell using React and Tailwind.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS
- React

### Continued development

- Create more projects to polish up tailwind, React and design principles using Figma and Adobe XD.
