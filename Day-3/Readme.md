## Overview

This is a challenge of the #100daysofUI and the prompt was as follows:

Prompt: Landing Page

What's the main focus? Is it for a book, an album, a mobile app, a SaaS product? Consider important landing page elements (Headlines, call-to-action buttons, typography, clarity, etc.)

## My process

- First I did research on the different types of UI landing pages from Dribbble and Behance websites.
- After that, I created a simple mockup using Adobe XD.
- Then I built a shell using React and Tailwind.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- React
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS

### Continued development

- Create more projects to polish up tailwind, React and design principles using Figma and Adobe XD.
