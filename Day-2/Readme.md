## My process

- First I did research on the different trypes of UI login pages from Dribbble and Behance websites.

- Then I built a shell using HTML and Tailwind.
- Added some small functionality using Javascript.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS
- React
- React Icons

### Continued development

- Create more projects to polish up tailwind, React and design principles using Figma.
