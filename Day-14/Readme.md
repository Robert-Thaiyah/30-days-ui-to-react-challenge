## Overview

This is a challenge of the #100daysofUI and the prompt was as follows:

Prompt: Countdown Timer

Is it for an app? An interface for an oven or cooking device? A sport related countdown such as on a scoreboard? Or is it a launch countdown for NASA, race cars, or something else?

## My process

- First I did research on the different types of countdown timer pages from Dribbble and Behance websites.
- After that, I created a simple mockup using Figma.
- Then I built a shell using React and Tailwind.
- Functionality will be added later.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS

### Continued development

- Create more projects to polish up tailwind, React and design principles using Figma.
